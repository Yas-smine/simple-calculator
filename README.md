# Simple Python Calculator (Jupyter Notebook)

## 📌 Description
This project is a simple calculator implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It performs the four basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.

## 🚀 Features
- Runs inside a Jupyter Notebook.
- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Asks for an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Handles division by zero with an error message.
- Loops until a valid operator is entered.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Open the `calculator.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the notebook cells.
3. Enter:
   - The first number.
   - The second number.
   - An operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

### Example run:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an arithmetic operator(+,-,*,/): *
Result: 50.0
